The online food and shopping system is developed so that customers can order food and shopping so as to avoid the hassles of waiting for the order taken and queuing to pay. Using the application, the end user registers online and reads the E-menu card to order online. Once the customers select the required items the service provider will be able to see the results on the screen and start processing the orders. This application nullifies the need for a extra personnel or reduces the workload of the server
The advantage is that the in a crowded restaurants and supermarkets there will be chances that the servers are overloaded with orders and are unable to meet the requirement of customers at a time. Therefore by using this application users can directly place orders online.
